# Typescript and I
After a year of tinkering with **Rust**:crab:, I've realized that my previously acquired knowledge of the typescript type system may require a refresher.
In **Rust**:crab:, having the `Option<T>` type was a game changer that significantly boosted my code quality. And I thought it would be a fun little exercise to revisit some typescript concepts with this in mind.

# Usage
Because this was simply a try, I would not recommend using this code in production.
Take a look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/option-t for a more complete implementation of the aforementioned paradigm, as they have also covered the `Result<T,E>` type.
